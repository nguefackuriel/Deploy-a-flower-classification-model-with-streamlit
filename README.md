# Deploy-a-flower-classification-model-with-streamlit

In this project, we will design a machine learning algorithm based on Gaussian Discriminant Analysis from scratch.

We will use the famous Iris Dataset.

After building our model, we will save it using pickle and deploy it using streamlit.

You will find everything you need to reproduce the project in this folder.
